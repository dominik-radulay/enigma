# enigma

This project was made for demonstrative purposes


Initial Configurations sets initial positions of "Rotors", before encoding of each letter, the "Fast rotor" moves by one position, untill finish whole rotation, after that, medium rotor move by one position. This proces continues until medium rotor finish whole rotation, which result in move of slow rotor by one position.

The Enigma encoding is symmetrical. If the A-key is transformed into the letter Q, 
it must be the case that the Q key would be
transformed into A for that particular rotor
setting.

The Enigma machine can never map a character 
into itself. Because of its construction and the symmetry of the transformation, it is never 
possible to have the letter A, for example,
come back as the letter A.
